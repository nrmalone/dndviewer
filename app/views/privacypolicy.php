All user-submitted images which fall under the umbrella of Fan Content are readily available at the '\img\characters' and '\img\maps' subdomains of this website as per Wizard's Fan Content policy.

User passwords provided during account registration and any sign-in and sign-out functionality thereafter are salted and hashed as well as stored away from the public branch of the website to minimize the risk of any user passwords being exposed in a data breach. In the case of a data breach, all users will be sent an email regarding a required change of password.

Users are provided the option to permanently delete their account and its associated data when signed in. Any accounts found to be inactive may be sent a verification email to claim their account within a 2 business week grace period before permanent deletion of user data. Any accounts unknowningly created can be deleted at specific request sent to <!-- INSERT CONTACT EMAIL ONCE WEBSITE IS SET UP. -->.
