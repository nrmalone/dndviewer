<strong>Email and Password Security</strong><br>
An email address is stored during account registration for the purpose of resetting/changing user account passwords and campaign passwords. The only further utilization of stored user emails is for opt-out communications between campaign DMs and player characters on a specific campaign basis as well as urgent communications between Dungeon Viewer and all website users.
<br><br>
User passwords provided during account registration and any sign-in and sign-out functionality thereafter are salted and hashed as well as stored away from the public branch of the website to minimize the risk of any user passwords being exposed in a data breach. In the case of a data breach, all users will be sent an email regarding a required change of password.
<br><br>
<strong>Account Deletion</strong><br>
Users are provided the option to permanently delete their account and its associated data when signed in. Any accounts found to be inactive may be sent a verification email to claim their account within a 2 business week grace period before permanent deletion of user data. Any accounts unknowningly created can be deleted at specific request sent to <!-- INSERT CONTACT EMAIL ONCE WEBSITE IS SET UP. -->. In case a potential user wishes to register again after their account is deleted, they should be able to re-register provided their account deletion was not the result of a misuse of the website and consequent ban.
<br><br>
<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><br>
Dungeon Viewer and contributors to its development are not to be held legally liable for any misuse of Dungeon Viewer that violates civil law or common law at any level of government jurisdiction. We also strive to police any content that crosses the line of good taste or playful banter. In case you feel any content or use of this website is in violation of law or our Community Guidelines (outlined below), please report it to <!-- INSERT CONTACT EMAIL ONCE WEBSITE IS SET UP. --> with details and we will act accordingly.

<h1 align="center">Community Guidelines</h1>
<ol align="left" style="width: 80%; margin: auto;">
    <li>
        User-generated content cannot contain excessive gore, nudity, or any explicit symbols of hate or overly controversial subjects.
        <ul>
            <li>We get that some aspects of gameplay and characters are meant to be antagonistic or grisly but please leave that to the imagination and verbal RP. Seeing isn't necessarily believing when you're playing a fantasy game.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Be respectful towards other members of the Dungeon Viewer community.
        <ul>
            <li>Dungeon Viewer is a tool for roleplaying games, not an outlet for distasteful behavior. Derogatory remarks towards others outside - and even sometimes during - roleplay are not acceptable.</li>
            <li>No one should be made to feel lesser because of their identity or traits beyond their control.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Remember that it's just a game and games are supposed to be fun.
        <ul>
            <li>Don't get carried away during roleplay if it's making you or a member of your campaign uncomfortable, and especially don't replicate anything heinous or illegal that you have done in gameplay in real life.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Don't share anything personal unless you want the world to know.
        <ul>
            <li>Since the internet is intangible and interconnected, anyone can screenshot, record, or copy any pre-existing content and share it somewhere else even if Dungeon Viewer gets taken offline in the future.</li>
            <li>We want everyone to feel and indeed BE safe while using Dungeon Viewer, so don't spread any info about yourself that puts you in danger or distress.</li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        If you see something that makes you uncomfortable, speak up.
        <ul>
            <li>Please report any inappropriate conduct to <!-- INSERT CONTACT EMAIL --> with details (preferably screenshots) and whether you would like us to followup with the outcome of our investigation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>    
</ol>
